## 3rd Party plugins

You might find that this modified snap of OBS Studio doesn't include a plugin that you use.
To install pre-compiled plugins, download and extract the plugin and put it in
`~/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/`.

For example, this is how the [Input Overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay)
plugin looks when correctly installed:

```
/home/username/snap/obs-studio/current/.config/obs-studio/plugins/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ input-overlay
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 64bit
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ input-overlay.so
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ locale
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ de-DE.ini
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en-US.ini
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ru-RU.ini
```

### Input Overlay

The OBS Studio snap bundles `libgamepad`, `libuihook` and `netlib` so that if
you want to use the [Input Overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay)
plugin, you can install it as outlined above then connect the joystick
interface as follows.

```shell
snap connect obs-studio:joystick
```

_The Input Overlay plugin is not shipped by default in the OBS Studio snap
because it introduced excessive CPU utilisation when bundled, although
works fine as a user-installed plugin. So we've made it as easy as possible
to add it yourself should you need it._

## Wayland

Screen and Window capture in a Wayland session is supported in OBS 27.0.0 or
newer.

## Removable Storage

To access content on external storage, manually connect to the removable-media plug:

```shell
snap connect obs-studio:removable-media
```

## OBS Virtual Camera

Starting with OBS Studio 26.1, Virtual Camera support is integrated. The
`Start Virtual Camera` button is located in the Controls pane, just below
`Start Recording`.

Here's how to install and configure `v4l2loopback` which OBS uses:

```shell
sudo snap connect obs-studio:kernel-module-observe
sudo apt -y install v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils
echo 'options v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=13 card_label="OBS Virtual Camera" exclusive_caps=1' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf
echo "v4l2loopback" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf
sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=13 card_label="OBS Virtual Camera" exclusive_caps=1
```

**NOTE!** Using `video_nr` greater than 64 will not work.

## NDI

If you want to use the [NDI](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi) plugin you'll need to connect the Avahi Control interface.

```shell
snap connect obs-studio:avahi-control
```

## Browser

Optional interfaces can be connected that integrate with Browser Sources and Custom Browser Socks.

### Process Control

The OBS Browser does attempt to adjust the scheduler priority, you can enable this capability by optionally connecting the `process-control` interface.

```shell
snap connect obs-studio:process-control
```

### Passwords and Keys

The browser in OBS can obtain user credentials from applications such as GNOME Passwords and Keys (seahorse) or Kwallet, should you want it to.

```shell
snap connect obs-studio:password-manager-service
```
